         1/19/24- This week we did our oobleck project where we made oobleck. It was very intresting and fun to see not only how oobleck is made, but how it works. The more force that it isimpacted on it, the more it'll harden, but the less force that is applied to it, it'll become more like a liquid. The way we made oobleck was mixing the right amounts of water and cornstartch.

         1/26/24- The project me and TrickyNick started this week is the Adruino Car project. In this project, we use TinkerCad to make a model of our car, code our Adruino, and power our Adruino using a breadboard. We so far are in the process of still using the breadboard to get out Adruino up and running.

This week our goals are too get started on the body of our car and finalize our mechanics for the car, by friday we should have our mechanics set in stone. Over the weeked I layed in bed, all day, saturday, sunday.

        2/13/24 - Last week we worked on the body of our car by cutting out cardboard for the body of our car. We also completed the problems we had with the Adruino of our car. The things we can do better for our car and improve it, is make sure our Adruino doesn't break every 4 seconds.

            3/4/24 - The project we are currently working on is trying to get an egg to not explode when you drop it, we are using many materials to try to make this experiment work. Our approach is to drop the egg while it is suspended by a parachute. Our design is strong in all aspects apart from the end part.

           Website Update - 3/13/2024: Our eggdrop project went well, our egg survived without a single scratch on it and so did our actual structure we built around the egg to keep it safe. The fall was fast and had a decently hard landing, but you could tell by the fall that the egg was okay.

            Our new project that we started this week is called the Gutter Boat. The goal is for us to make a boat with given materials to go down a gutter for a certain distance as fast as possible. We are approaching the problem by making the best boat mankind has ever conceived. I expect to be the winner winner chicken dinner of my project.

        4-5-24- The project we completed in these past 2 weeks was the paper boat. Our project went bad becasue our boat didn't even last 3 seconds due to Nick absolutely throwing. I loved this class because it was easy and fun and had my friends in it. THis weekend im going to RAAAAAAAAAAAA"s

            I couldn't get a video of us testing our project because Nick refused to send it to me

        4/15/24- The project we started last week is our final project of the year, the cardboard boat project. We have to create a boat that is able to carry two people back and fourth in the school pool, our materials are only one roll of duct tape and cardboard. I'm excited to ride in the boat because im 5'3. The project we completed last week was the post-it note project. This summer im looking foward to getting my band's first offical couple songs finished and done with.
