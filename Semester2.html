         1/19/24- This week we did our oobleck project where we made oobleck. It was very intresting and fun to see not only how oobleck is made, but how it works. The more force that it isimpacted on it, the more it'll harden, but the less force that is applied to it, it'll become more like a liquid. The way we made oobleck was mixing the right amounts of water and cornstartch.

         1/26/24- The project me and TrickyNick started this week is the Adruino Car project. In this project, we use TinkerCad to make a model of our car, code our Adruino, and power our Adruino using a breadboard. We so far are in the process of still using the breadboard to get out Adruino up and running.

        2/13/24 - Last week we worked on the body of our car by cutting out cardboard for the body of our car. We also completed the problems we had with the Adruino of our car. The things we can do better for our car and improve it, is make sure our Adruino doesn't break every 4 seconds.
