         1/19/24- This week we did our oobleck project where we made oobleck. It was very intresting and fun to see not only how oobleck is made, but how it works. The more force that it isimpacted on it, the more it'll harden, but the less force that is applied to it, it'll become more like a liquid. The way we made oobleck was mixing the right amounts of water and cornstartch.
