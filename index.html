            <a href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=best+website">My Favorite Website</a>
        </p> In Engineering class this week I've been enjoying the process of starting up our website to log all our stuff for the coming year. I enjoyed our first game outside with the rods and marble, even though our side never made it once, it was a fun activity and it was fun watching the oppoisite side get in the bucket. I really liked learning how to setup and bootup our websites so that we can customize them to our liking. I also enjoyd seeing the work behind the website and getting into the website's code. I also have been listening a lot to Rage Against the Machine's album, "Evil Empire" a lot this week.

            9/1/23 - One engineering dicipline I learned this week is to always wear protective gear to prevent anyone from getting hurt. One challenge we did is the marble game. One thing I started designing this week is my group's project to pop a ballon. The challenge was very fun even though my team never finished, but it was fun watching the other group get the marble inside.

        9/8/23 - My week went good, I did a lot of schoolwork. I learned how to use tinkercad and test my group's project. Our rube goldberg machine is vey cool, we're using a lever machine, inclined plane, and a pulley. The most challenging part about the machine is dealing with Nicholas Tamezacon, he is very not smart and can't follow directions so he is hard to work with.
